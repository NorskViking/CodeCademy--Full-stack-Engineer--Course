# Mixed Messages

The purpose of this project was to use javascript, html and css to create a simple webpage, with a button that would print to screen, a random message from an array.

In my solution, I decided for jokes.

### Known bugs
 - JavaScript works by itself, but unable to load into HTML during testing.
 - Same problem with CSS stylesheet and json-file.
